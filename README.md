1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main? 3 Dog objects, one arraylist of Dogs, and a comparator of Dogs.

3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?
No, I had to make a class definition within a new file and import the Dogs.java file to get the comparator to work.
